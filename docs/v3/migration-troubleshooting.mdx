## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: LLM Not Found

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandasai.llm'`

**Solution**: Install the appropriate LLM extension

```bash
pip install pandasai-litellm
```

### Issue: Skills Not Working

**Problem**: Skills not being recognized

**Solution**: Use the new `@pai.skill()` decorator

```python
# v2
from pandasai.skills import skill
@skill
def my_skill():
    pass

# v3
import pandasai as pai
@pai.skill()
def my_skill():
    "doc string"
    pass
```

### Issue: Configuration Not Applied

**Problem**: Configuration settings not taking effect

**Solution**: Use global configuration

```python
# v2
df = SmartDataframe(data, config=config)

# v3
pai.config.set(config)
df = pai.DataFrame(data)
```
