<Note title="Beta Notice">
Release v3 is currently in beta. This documentation reflects the features and functionality in progress and may change before the final release.
</Note>

The [data platform](/v3/ai-dashboards) allows you to control access to your AI dashboards and dataframes. 
You can choose between different levels of access:
- Private: for your own use
- Public: available to anyone with a PandasAI account
- Password-protected: requires a password to access
- Organization: for use within your organization

Each access level determines who can view and interact with your dataframes, and who consumes query quota when asking questions to the AI agent.

## Private Dataframes
Private dataframes are accessible only by their owner. When asking questions to the agent, the owner consumes their own query quota.

## Public Dataframes
Public dataframes are accessible by anyone with a PandasAI account. They are indexed on the web for discovery. When users ask questions, they consume their own query quota.

## Password-Protected Dataframes
Password-protected dataframes require a password to access. When accessing these dataframes, the owner's query quota is consumed.

## Organization Dataframes
Organization dataframes are available within your organization based on assigned permissions. Users can have read-only or write access as determined by the organization owner and administrators.
