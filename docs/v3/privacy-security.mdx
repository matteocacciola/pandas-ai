## Code Execution and Sandbox Environment

PandasAI executes Python code that is generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). While this provides powerful data analysis capabilities, it's crucial to understand the security implications, especially in production use cases where your application might be exposed to potential malicious attacks.

### Why Use a Sandbox?

When building applications that allow users to interact with PandasAI, there's a potential risk that malicious users might attempt to manipulate the LLM into generating harmful code. To mitigate this risk, PandasAI provides a secure sandbox environment with the following features:

- **Isolated Execution**: Code runs in a completely isolated Docker container
- **Offline Operation**: The sandbox runs entirely offline, preventing any external network requests
- **Resource Limitations**: Strict controls on system resource usage
- **File System Isolation**: Protected access to the file system

### Using the Sandbox

To use the sandbox environment, you first need to install the required package and have Docker running on your system:

```bash
pip install pandasai-docker
```

<Note title="Sandbox Requirements">
  Make sure you have Docker running on your system before using the sandbox
  environment.
</Note>

Here's how to enable the sandbox for your PandasAI chat:

```python
import pandasai as pai
from pandasai_docker import DockerSandbox
from pandasai_litellm.litellm import LiteLLM

# Initialize LiteLLM with your OpenAI model
llm = LiteLLM(model="gpt-4.1-mini", api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Configure PandasAI to use this LLM
pai.config.set({
    "llm": llm
})

# initialize the sandbox
sandbox = DockerSandbox()
sandbox.start()

# read a csv as df
df = pai.read_csv("./data/heart.csv")

# pass the df and the sandbox
result = pai.chat("plot total heart patients by gender", df, sandbox=sandbox)

# display the chart
result.show()

# stop the sandbox (docker container)
sandbox.stop()
```

### When to Use the Sandbox

We strongly recommend using the sandbox environment in the following scenarios:

- Building public-facing applications
- Processing untrusted user inputs
- Deploying in production environments
- Handling sensitive data
- Multi-tenant environments

### Enterprise Sandbox Options

For production-ready use cases, we offer several advanced sandbox options as part of our Enterprise license. These include:

- Custom security policies
- Advanced resource management
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Additional isolation layers
