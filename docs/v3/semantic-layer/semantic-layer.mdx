</Note>

PandasAI 3.0 introduces a new feature: the semantic layer, which allows you to turn raw data into semantic-enhanced and clean dataframes, making it easier to work with and analyze your data.

## What's the Semantic Layer?

The semantic layer allows you to turn raw data into dataframes you can ask questions to as conversational AI dashboards. It serves several important purposes:

1. **Data configuration**: Define how your data should be loaded and processed
2. **Semantic information**: Add context and meaning to your data columns
3. **Data transformation**: Specify how data should be cleaned and transformed

## How to start using the Semantic Layer?

In order to use the semantic layer, you need to create a new schema for each dataset you want to work with.
