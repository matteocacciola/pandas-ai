Skills allow you to add custom functions on a **global level** that extend PandasAI's capabilities beyond standard data analysis. Once a skill is defined using the `@pai.skill()` decorator, it becomes automatically available across your entire application - whether you're using `pai.chat()`, `SmartDataframe`, or `Agent`. These custom functions are registered globally and can be used by any PandasAI interface without additional configuration.

## Creating a Skill

Skills are created by decorating a Python function with `@pai.skill()`. The function should include clear documentation with type hints and a descriptive docstring, as the AI uses this information to understand when and how to use the skill.

### Basic Skill Definition

```python
import pandasai as pai

@pai.skill()
def my_custom_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> str:
    """
    A custom function that demonstrates skill creation.

    Args:
        param1 (str): First parameter description
        param2 (int): Second parameter description

    Returns:
        str: Result description
    """
    return f"Processed {param1} with value {param2}"
```

### Example Skills

Here are some practical examples of skills you can create:

```python
import pandasai as pai

@pai.skill()
def calculate_bonus(salary: float, performance: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates employee bonus based on salary and performance score.

    Args:
        salary (float): Employee's base salary
        performance (float): Performance score (0-100)

    Returns:
        float: Calculated bonus amount
    """
    if performance >= 90:
        return salary * 0.15  # 15% bonus for excellent performance
    elif performance >= 70:
        return salary * 0.10  # 10% bonus for good performance
    else:
        return salary * 0.05  # 5% bonus for average performance

@pai.skill()
def plot_salaries(names: list[str], salaries: list[float]):
    """
    Creates a bar chart showing employee salaries.

    Args:
        names (list[str]): List of employee names
        salaries (list[float]): List of corresponding salaries
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.bar(names, salaries)
    plt.xlabel("Employee Name")
    plt.ylabel("Salary ($)")
    plt.title("Employee Salaries")
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

@pai.skill()
def format_currency(amount: float) -> str:
    """
    Formats a number as currency.

    Args:
        amount (float): The amount to format

    Returns:
        str: Formatted currency string
    """
    return f"${amount:,.2f}"
```

## Skills in Action

Once skills are defined, they are automatically available to all PandasAI interfaces. Here's how to use them with different components:

### Skills with pai.chat

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Skills are automatically registered when defined
@pai.skill()
def get_employee_stats(employee_id: int) -> dict:
    """
    Gets comprehensive statistics for an employee.

    Args:
        employee_id (int): The employee ID

    Returns:
        dict: Employee statistics including salary, bonus, and performance
    """
    # Your logic to fetch employee data
    return {
        "id": employee_id,
        "salary": 60000,
        "bonus": 9000,
        "performance": 92
    }

# Use pai.chat with the skill automatically available
response = pai.chat("Get statistics for employee ID 1 and calculate their total compensation")
# The AI will use both get_employee_stats() and calculate_bonus() skills
print(response)
```

### Skills with Agent

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandasai as pai
from pandasai import Agent
from pandasai_litellm.litellm import LiteLLM

# Add your model
llm = LiteLLM(model="ollama/llama3", api_base="http://localhost:11434/api/generate")

pai.config.set({"llm": llm})

# Sample employee data
employees_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["John", "Emma", "Liam", "Olivia", "William"],
    "Department": ["HR", "Sales", "IT", "Marketing", "Finance"],
    "Salary": [50000, 60000, 70000, 55000, 65000],
    "Performance": [85, 92, 78, 88, 95]
}

salaries_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Bonus": [7500, 9000, 7000, 5500, 9750]
}

employees_df = pai.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pai.DataFrame(salaries_data)

# Create an agent with the dataframes
agent = Agent([employees_df, salaries_df], memory_size=10)

# Chat with the agent - skills are automatically available
response1 = agent.chat("Calculate bonuses for all employees and show the results")
print("Response 1:", response1)

response2 = agent.chat("Show me the total bonus amount formatted as currency")
print("Response 2:", response2)

# The agent can use multiple skills in one conversation
response3 = agent.chat("Calculate bonuses, format them as currency, and create a chart")
print("Response 3:", response3)
```
